# Projectr: Making Project-Based-Learning Simple
Hackathon project submitted to [DubHacks 2017] (http://dubhacks.co)

### Inspiration:
During the ideation workshop hosted by DubHacks, we had talked to representatives of Teach for America about creating education equity for all. We noticed that elementary school teachers may not have as much teaching resources compared to those teaching in higher educational institutions; thus, we wanted to provide a solution to increase the accessibility of project-based learning resources.

### What it does:
Our web app is a platform for teachers to share project-based learning teaching ideas. While specifically targeting elementary school teachers as our main audience, we made our platform to be open source so as to avoid limiting creative teaching methods.

### How we built it:
We built the web app through via Javascript, HTML/CSS and Bootstrap for the front-end development and Node.js, jQuery, and Firebase for the back-end development.

### What we learned:
This is our first hackathon for 3/4 members hence this was a very educational experience
